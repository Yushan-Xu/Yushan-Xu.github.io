# Yushan Xu 徐羽杉
**Research Assistant**  
Audio Experience Design Lab, Imperial College London  

I’m a researcher and designer working at the intersection of **spatial acoustics, auditory perception, and interactive media**.  
My work explores how humans experience sound and multisensory stimuli in immersive environments — combining **audio engineering, perceptual studies, interactive visualization, and tangible interface design**.

This website presents my **research projects**, **publications**, and **selected design works**.  
Feel free to explore my [Portfolio](/portfolio/) or download my [CV](/cv/).
