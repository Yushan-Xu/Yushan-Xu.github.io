**Research Assistant**  
Audio Experience Design Lab, Imperial College London  

I’m a researcher and designer working at the intersection of **spatial acoustics, auditory perception, and interactive media**.  
My work focuses on how humans experience sound in immersive environments — combining **audio engineering, perceptual studies, and interactive visualization**.

This website presents my **research projects**, **publications**, and **selected design works**.
