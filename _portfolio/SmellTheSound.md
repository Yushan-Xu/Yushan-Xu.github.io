Smell the Sound is a collaborative installation that turns voice into scent in real time.  
By analyzing vocal features such as frequency, envelope, and harmonics, the system converts speech into olfactory signals, allowing people to “smell” their own sound.  
The project explores the boundaries between hearing and smell, and reflects on how technology extends human perception and emotion.  
My role focused on sound analysis, system integration, and Arduino/MaxMSP implementation.
